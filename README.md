# Readme
This website (index.html) (and style.css under assets) has been optimized with semantics, and to improve load time, as well as search engine optimization.
This work was done for a digital marketing company. 
Any developer looking at the code with basic understanding of html5 and css should be able to continue working on the website and updating the website.
